        %span Concept Prototype
      The project, 
      %emph Designing ICTs for Increasing Smallholder Farmers
      Access to Markets and Knowledge, identifies needs and defines opportunities through which innovative information and communication technology (ICT)-based applications and systems can increase agricultural small-holder productivity, profitability, and sustainability.

      The project is predicted to be completed at the end of Spring 2015, at which time, one of the following applications of the ICT will be possible:
      %ul 
        %li A digital library interface accessible to the smallholder farmers through the web.
        %li An aggregate of knowledge collected from small-scale farmers.
        %li A communication tool between farmers and other agencies.

        %li Prepare a survey paper about the state of the art in Information and Communication Technologies in sub-Saharan Africa.
        %li Maintain a weekly journal documenting their work and findings, which they will share during the weekly meetings. (Required by CREU)
        %li Collaborate on maintaining a common website for their project, which will include their collaborative work. 
        %li Provide a mid-year progress report at the end of the Fall 2011 semester & end of the year summary of their work.
        %li With help from the faculty advisor, students will identify appropriate venues to publish their work

          People from Gates and UN
          Egronomy and new type of sensors for agriculture
          Sensor-based stuff
          getting sensors into farmer’s hands
          soil, humidity, composition, weather
          rain fall monitoring, standard size container, measure it and record
          standardization of measuring instrument
          measuring levels and writing is hard for farmers
          is there an automated way of recording this data
          vision based approach?
          reduce burden of record these measurements
          person from east africa cgi groups, does stuff with landscape and ecosystem
          distributed rainfall network
          rainfall meters
          rainfall monitoring network
          use schools as a baseline and extrapolate rainfall patterns
          participatory research w/ farmers in west farmers showed interest in measuring rainfall more accurately
          difficulty: accurately measure production, yields
          new types of processes, bundling, but probably tried before
          vision based approach, make inferences about total yield
          could make big impact on agricultural research even though very straightforward

            %li visualization

          %h5 Project Ideas

          %ul
            %li lots of groups collected data about farmers but data not integrated, whats a way to do this while keeping in mind privacy, cloud-based approach
            %li visualization came up a lot, current tools not really good, are there tools for people higher the value chain other than tableau, how to share visualizations back to farmers
            %li low end data acquisition challenges are good place to go to really create something new
            %li what are ways of representing that data to farmers and middlemen
            %li low cost system for farmers and farm communities to reason 
            %li rainfall and rain activity
            %li keep customers in mind
            %li pilot test in central valley
            %li then try in africa
